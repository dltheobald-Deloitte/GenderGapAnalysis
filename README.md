## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The packages required for this module are:
- numpy
- pandas
- os
- matplotlib
- sklearn

Other than sklearn, there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2018 to better understand the gap between men and women.
The way I deconstructed this was by asking:

1. How big is the disparity in pay between men and women?
2. How does having children impact job progression?
3. Women in STEMâ€¦ Is there really an obstacle?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook 'Blog_prep.ipynb' contains the exploratory analysis involved with answering the questions above and outlining the thought process I used to attack these issues. It also contains the code which generates the materials used for the blog which are saved as '.png' files. Within the notebook, there is also some additional information there to showcase what I would have done if I had implemented a machine learning model. I have also included a .gitignore file as the dataset was too large to upload so I have ignore this and created a .pkl file instead. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available (https://medium.com/p/21c91db2a6b4/edit).
